  "readme": "`miniLockLib` is a little [miniLock](http://minilock.io/) library.\n\nDownload [`miniLockLib.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/45678/miniLockLib/master/scripts/miniLockLib.js) and add it to your page with a `<script>` tag:\n\n    <script src=\"miniLockLib.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\nNow you are ready to call `miniLockLib` methods from your Javascript program...\n\n__Examples__\n\nCall `miniLockLib.makeKeyPair` with a `secretPhrase` and `emailAddress` to get a pair of `keys`:\n\n    miniLockLib.makeKeyPair(secretPhrase, emailAddress, function(error, keys){\n      if (keys) {\n        keys.publicKey is a Uint8Array\n        keys.secretKey is a Uint8Array\n        error is undefined\n      } else {\n        error is a String explaining the failure\n        keys is undefined\n       }\n    })\n\nPass `data`, `name`, `keys` and `miniLockIDs` when you `encrypt` a file:\n\n    miniLockLib.encrypt({\n      data: blob,\n      name: 'sensitive_document.txt'\n      keys: {publicKey: Uint8Array, secretKey: Uint8Array},\n      miniLockIDs: [aliceID, bobbyID, ...]\n      callback: function(error, encrypted) {\n        encrypted.data is a Blob of the encrypted data\n        encrypted.data.size is the Number of bytes in the encrypted file\n        encrypted.data.type is 'application/minilock'\n        encrypted.name is 'sensitive document.txt.minilock'\n        encrypted.senderID is the miniLock ID of the person who encrypted the file\n      }\n    })\n\nPass `data` and `keys` when you `decrypt` a file:\n\n    miniLockLib.decrypt({\n      data: blob,\n      keys: {publicKey: Uint8Array, secretKey: Uint8Array},\n      callback: function(error, decrypted) {\n        decrypted.data is a Blob of the decrypted data\n        decrypted.data.size is the Number of bytes in the decrypted file\n        decrypted.name is the decrypted name of file as a String\n        decrypted.senderID is the miniLock ID of the person who encrypted the file\n      }\n    })\n\n[See more examples in the tests](https://github.com/45678/miniLockLib/blob/master/tests/0%20A%20demo%20of...%20tests.coffee) or [read the source code](https://github.com/45678/miniLockLib/blob/master/library/index.coffee) for all the terrible details.\n\n__Sources__\n\n`miniLockLib` is composed of code from six dandy little projects:\n\n`Base58.js` is a copy of the [cryptocoinjs bs58 library](https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/bs58). It has been modified to work in a web agent window instead of a node.js environment. And the filename was changed to match the global `Base58` address that it defines. `Base58` is used to encode and decode miniLock IDs.\n\n`BLAKE2s.js` is an unmodified copy of Dmitry Chestnykh’s [blake2s-js project](https://github.com/dchest/blake2s-js). The filename of the script was renamed to match the global `BLAKE2s` address that it defines.\n\n`nacl.js` is a copy of the [tweetnacl-js crypto library](https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-js) written by Dmitry Chestnykh. It has been modified to assign itself to `this` instead of `window` so that it can be imported seamlessly into a crypto worker. `nacl` is used throughout `miniLockLib` for a variety of cryptographic functions.\n\n`nacl-stream.js` is an unmodified copy of the [tweetnacl-js streaming encryption library](https://github.com/dchest/nacl-stream-js) written by Dmitry Chestnykh. Streaming encryption is employed in a crypto worker.\n\n`scrypt-async.js` is an unmodified script from Dmitry Chestnykh’s [scrypt-async-js](https://github.com/dchest/scrypt-async-js) project. It is used to derive a key pair from a secret phrase and email address.\n\n`zxcvbn.js` is an unmodified copy of Dropbox’s [zxcvbn password strength estimator](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn). `miniLockLib` uses this library to calculate the entropy present in secret phrases.\n\n__Digging In__\n\n`npm install git+https://git@github.com/45678/miniLockLib.git` to get the source code.\n\n`npm test` launch the test kit in Google Chrome.\n\n`npm start` to begin watching CoffeeScript files. Your saved changes will trigger automatic re-compilation.\n\n`make` to re-compile the `scripts`. Source files are compiled to `library.compiled` and saved as `scripts/miniLockLib.js`. Tests are compiled to `tests.compiled` and saved as `scripts/tests.js`.\n",
